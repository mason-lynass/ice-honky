# Ice Honky

Ice Honky is a live-updating NHL Scoreboard celebrating the sounds of the sport. When a team scores, you'll hear their goal horn!

This website uses the [NHL Score API](https://github.com/peruukki/nhl-score-api) developed by Harri Lehtola.

## Setup

Feel free to clone this repo to run Ice Honky on your computer - you could change things to only display certain teams, or change the API polling rate (but please don't make it poll too often, we don't want to be too expensive!).

`
git clone git@github.com:mason-lynass/ice-honky.git
cd ice-honky
npm install
npm start
